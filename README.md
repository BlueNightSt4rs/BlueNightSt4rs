# NickNames
✦ I go by tia/a, rain. my other nicks are egostaria, skii. I prefer tiaa and rain, if your a close friend call me egostaria or skii, İ dont really mind if we are close. 

✦ these times I have double + stalker + ex friend, I had to unfriend her, she was weird. anyways she was saying "You *Copy* 'Riaa's name, arent you Nerveous, 'tiaa?'" actually no, I have the tiaa nick for like 2 years? im pretty sure that i dont copy @ Loudshqrk's name. most people has the tiaa nick guys.
